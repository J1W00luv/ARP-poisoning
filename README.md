# ARP Poisoning Lab

**This repository contains documentation of a simulated MitM attack in a controlled lab environment. The goal was to understand how traffic can be catched and how different protocols have different levels of security.**

[Click here to view the documentation](ARPPoisoning.md)

**Tools used:**
1. VirtualBox to create a safe environment.
2. Nmap for host discovery.
3. Arpspoof and Wireshark for data capturing.
4. A-Packets for analysis.

**Skills gained/used:**
* Security Analysis (Identifying communication protocols & how they can be exploited)
* Defense Awareness (Learning about end-to-end importance for protocols)
* Vulnerability Exploitation (Reading data sent through HTTP without encryption)
